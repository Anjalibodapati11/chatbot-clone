AI ChatBot Clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a frontend-only chatbot clone inspired by ChatGPT. It simulates real-time conversations between a user and a chatbot. The chatbot gives predefined or random responses, mimicking the interaction style of an AI assistant.

 Objective:
The objective of this project is to:

Build a chat interface using basic web technologies

Simulate a chatbot using JavaScript logic

Practice building real-world, interactive UI components

Lay the foundation for future integration with real AI APIs like OpenAI

Technologies Used:
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structure of the chat layout
CSS3	Styling chat messages, layout
JavaScript	Bot logic, typing effect, DOM updates

 Key Features: Clean chat interface (user + bot)

 Simulated "Typing..." animation

 Chat scrolls automatically

 Randomized bot replies

 Input validation

 Mobile-responsive layout

How It Works:
The user types a message in the input box and hits Send

The chatbot replies with a simulated delay (typing effect)

Replies are randomly chosen from a set of predefined responses

The interface mimics real messaging apps, with bubble-style messages
 Limitations:
Not connected to a backend or AI API

Cannot store chat history

Bot logic is rule-based, not intelligent

Future Enhancements:
Connect with OpenAI or Dialogflow for real AI answers

Add chat history with localStorage or a database

Add user login and profiles

Use WebSockets for real-time backend chat
Conclusion:
This chatbot clone is a simple but effective simulation of a conversational AI. It demonstrates proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation, and offers a great base to integrate future AI and backend features.
